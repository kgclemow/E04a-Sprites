# E04a-Sprites
This is an exercise to start playing with sprites and physics in Godot.

The project excercise requires the making of nodes and child nodes (who are not selectable). The child nodes are falling sprite assets who I sized down, changed the physics of, and added a collision sibling. In the exercise, I also created static sprites with collision siblings which the falling sprites bounce off of along with the walls of the game.
